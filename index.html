          A hunger strike in support of Proportional Representation ended yesterday, on the 100th anniversary of the first women’s suffrage movement.

        407 people from across the UK took part in the strike, which began at 8pm the previous night and lasted for 24 hours. The group Make Votes Matter has cross-party support, and campaigns for Proportional Representation in the UK (to replace First Past the Post).

<p>
  A proportional representation system would provide a Parliament divided according to the exact number of votes each party receives in an election. This is opposed to the current system whereby a person votes within their constituency, and Parliament is consequently divided according to the number of constituencies each party wins.

  Supporters from Sheffield held a vigil for the cause outside the Town Hall from 8.30am till 5.30pm. Participants included former leader of the Green Party, Natalie Bennett.

  She said: “The hunger strike is a homage to the suffragettes, who of course went on long-term hunger strike; we’re simply fasting for 24 hours.”

      Yesterday also marked 100 years of the Representation of People’s Act 1918, which granted the vote to property owning women over the age of 30 as well as all men over 21.  Make Votes Matter argue that we still do not have full suffrage, because of the voting system in place, most votes cast to not affect the final outcome.

<p> Sheffield had an important role to play in the history of women’s suffrage. The first known women’s suffrage society in the U.K, The Sheffield Women’s Political Association, was founded in the city. Emmeline Pankhurst’s youngest daughter Adela also turned her home in Broomhill into the headquarters of the Sheffield Suffrage Movement during the years that she lived in the city (1910 to 1912).

  <h2> Make Votes Matter </h2>

</p>


<p>
Make Votes Matter was set up after the 2015 General Election, when the Conservatives were elected to power despite receiving less than 37% of the vote share. The group argues that the ‘First past the Post’ system means many votes don't matter and people often vote tactically in order to prevent certain parties from gaining a seat, and do not actually vote for the candidate they want to represent them.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote class="bq_two">
 "We just want to join the 21st century". <br> ~ <em>Jack Carrington</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Jack Carrington, Finance Director for Make Votes Matter, was also hunger-striking. He said: “In 2015, 74% of all votes cast were wasted, as they didn’t have any effect on the outcome. So most of the people are disenfranchised from democracy”.
</p>
<p>
  “Most of the world’s free democracies have a form of proportional representation, we just want to join the 21st-century along with them.”
</p>

    The first past the post system fails to represent voters accurately. In the 2015 General Election, 36.9% of the votes were for the Conservatives, but they ended up with 50.9.% of the seats.

  </p>

  <p>
    UKIP received 12.6% but only ended up with 1 MP, 0.2% of the seats.
